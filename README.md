This gem receives the location of a txt file, reads it and turns it into HTML code.

Lines are converted to paragraphs by default, but certain marks in a line cause it to be turned into other markups:

* %T1%       => will make the line to be converted to html h1 tag
* %T2%       => will make the line to be converted to html h2 tag
* %T3%       => will make the line to be converted to html h3 tag
* %T4%       => will make the line to be converted to html h4 tag
* %T5%       => will make the line to be converted to html h5 tag
* %T6%       => will make the line to be converted to html h6 tag

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, your help is welcome, for sure. But please, read this before you start, so you won't tell me you didn't knew these things beforehand:

01) We are here to develop some software, not to discuss politics, race, religion, gender or any other issue the 'politically correct' people like to raise to disguise their inability to make things happen.

02) Opinions given by any developer outside the scope of this project are not our business. We don't care about what what you think, as long as you do NOT bring your opinions to this development space.

03) You may not raise issues about things not related to this project. This includes issues related to other developer's opinions given outside here.

04) Just to summarize all things said before: **Keep your personal stuff far away from this project and discuss only the project here**.

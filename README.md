This gem receives the location of a txt file, reads it and turns it into HTML code.

Lines are converted to paragraphs by default, but certain marks in a line cause it to be turned into other markups:

* %T1%       => will make the line to be converted to html h1 tag
* %T2%       => will make the line to be converted to html h2 tag
* %T3%       => will make the line to be converted to html h3 tag
* %T4%       => will make the line to be converted to html h4 tag
* %T5%       => will make the line to be converted to html h5 tag
* %T6%       => will make the line to be converted to html h6 tag
